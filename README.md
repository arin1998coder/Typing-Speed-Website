Typing Speed Checker

Built Using Javascript , HTML and CSS.

1.It fetches a random quote from a Quote API and displays on the UI.

2.On Click of START button a Timer starts that runs for 1 min.

3.Type the sentence in the quote as fast as possible to get a measure of how fast you can type and whats your accuracy.

4.I have implemented a character by character comparison check with the user ip and the quote character using "input" event listener.

5.Using this char by character check with user input and the quote , the num of mistakes commited by user during the typing is also tracked and displayed.

6.Used color visualization to help user track how much part of the Quote he/she has typed, the portion of the quote that is typed correct is marked "Green" and the portion of the quote which user types wrong is marked "RED". All this happens dynamically while user writes.

7.On click of Stop Test user is shown its Result.
